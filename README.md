# Draw And Guess

## Overview
Draw And Guess is a casual and creative drawing game for 3-10 people! The game is built for Android and supports local and online multiplayer.

In local mode, the phone device acts as a drawing/guessing board and the players take turns using it. A random word is chosen and the first player draws it without using characters or numbers. The next player guesses the word behind the drawing. Then another one draws it again! The cycle continues until the end of the round, as in, after everyone plays and the device goes back to the first player.

The online mode functions in the same way, the difference being that every player has a board and plays simultaneously. Each player only draws/guesses once in each board.

At the end of each round all the results are displayed to the players allowing everyone to see the creations and interpretations.
